          <p className="child--title">v.1 - Updated November 17th 2022</p>
          <p>
            This Opspad Privacy Policy is deemed to demonstrate that our
            visitors’, partners’ and customers’ (collectively “you” or “your”)
            privacy is one of Opspad’s cardinal objectives, especially when
            using any Opspad services or accessing this website. It sets forth
            the manner and legal commitments which any of the worldwide Opspad
            entities agrees to maintain in collecting, processing and (where
            applicable) disclosing information about users of this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using the Opspad website, our products and/or services you agree
            to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h4>Collection of Information</h4>
          <p>
            Opspad gathers information in most of its interactions with you,
            whether directly or indirectly. Although some of the information may
            be considered as “Personal Data”, most of the gathered information
            is not Personal Data. Personal Data is defined as information that
            can be used on its own or with other information to identify,
            contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in
            context.
          </p>
          <p>
              Opspad has taken extensive safety and operational precautions,
            including administrative, physical and technical safeguards to
            protect personal information. Furthermore, Plesk deploys reasonable
            safeguards across the company databases to prevent unauthorized
            access, disclosure or loss of personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where information is provided to Opspad for the purpose of the
            establishment of a contractual relationship, Opspad processes your
            data on the basis of Article 6 I b) GDPR. In all other cases, your
            data is processed on basis of and in accordance to your explicit
            consent as required by Article 6 I a) GDPR.
          </p>
          <h4>Information received from you directly</h4>
          <p>
            Opspad collects and stores information during the registration of
            products, the creation of online profiles, the application via our
            website and any contact for support or other matters (e.g. contact
            or comment forms, telephone contact). Examples of information
            transmitted by you:
          </p>
          <div>
            <ul className='list'>
              <li>Name, address, phone number, email address</li>
              <li>IP addresses</li>
              <li>Billing and other purchasing and shipping information;</li>
              <li>
                Records of transactions, including purchases, inquiries and
                service requests;
              </li>
              <li>
                Authentication data such as user name and password to verify
                access.
              </li>
              <li>
                Application Data, CVs, profiles, pictures (additional Job
                Applicant Data Policy in place)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            Opspad does not collect or process any credit card data during
            purchases. Any credit card purchase is made through our reliable and
            secure online payment processor (Worldpay), with the result that
            Opspad is never furnished with your sensitive credit card
            information; In order to provide its services, its websites or
            fulfill its contractual obligations to you, Opspad may be required
            to forward data which may include some of your personal information
            to third parties. In order to follow the requirements of data
            minimization, the data so transferred is reduced to the necessary
            minimum. Those subcontractors are required to adhere to a data
            processing agreement with Opspad under which they are committed to
            process data solely in accordance with the applicable laws
            (including the GDPR and other national privacy laws). This
            processing includes a required screening of your provided data
            against international export and economic sanctions lists by Opspad.
            A negative (no match) screening result is a mandatory requirement
            for Opspad to communicate with, deal with, do business with or
            provide any form of services to you. The WebPros “Export and
            Sanctions Compliance Policy” applies accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Opspad has an extensive data protection policy in place across its
            organization, which every Opspad employee or contractor must adhere
            to at all times. Such data protection policy sets forth the
            mandatory way, information is expected to be handled within Opspad
            and describes the necessary internal processes and the required
            level of confidentiality to be maintained in order to be compliant
            with national and international data protection laws (like e.g.
            GDPR).
          </p>
          <p>
            Opspad strives to comply with the concept of data minimization
            (“privacy by default”) by only collecting as much information as
            needed for the intended and approved purpose. Only information which
            is relevant to such purpose and which has been provided to Opspad in
            free and informed manner by you as the data subject will be
            processed by Opspad for as long as needed for the purpose.
            Thereafter, any Personal Data is subject to a defined deletion
            routine as defined in Opspad’s record of processing activities
            created and maintained in accordance to Article 30 of the GDPR.
          </p>
          <>
          <h4>Information Collected Automatically</h4>
          <p>
            Opspad may automatically collect and store information about how
            users utilize the Opspad website(s) and applications. This may
            include anonymized IP addresses of website visitors, browser type
            and other information such as search terms, which helps us to
            improve our services and our website to provide you with the best
            possible services and user experience. Any so collected data which
            may be considered as Personal Data is subject to immediate
            anonymization upon its collection with the result that the
            automatically-collected data will not allow Opspad or any other
            party to identify you.
          </p>
          <h4>Data Protection for Minors</h4>
          <p>
            The Opspad website as well as its contents, services and offers are
            not directed at children or minors. Accordingly, Opspad does not
            want and does not assume that any information collected on the
            Opspad website or any forum will be personal data pertaining to
            children or minors. Any data which is identified as belonging to a
            child or minor is subject to immediate deletion.
          </p>
          <h4>Is my data secure at Opspad ?</h4>
          <p>
            Opspad has implemented appropriate technical and organizational
            measures related to the respective processing purpose in order to
            protect the Personal Data provided by you against abuse and loss.
            Personal Data and other information about you are stored in a secure
            operating environment that is not accessible to the public. Any data
            transmission performed by Opspad is encrypted during transmission
            via SSL. In addition, each of Opspad’s employees is contractually
            bound by comprehensive confidentiality and non-disclosure terms and
            is further required to abide by the Opspad data protection policy at
            all times.
          </p>
          </>
          <h4>What are my rights?</h4>
          <p>
            You have the following rights in respect to the Personal Data you
            provide to Opspad:
          </p>
          <ul  className='list'>
            <li>
              You may at any time request Opspad to delete the data you provided
              or withdraw any data processing consent you provided to Opspad by
              contacting privacy@opspad.com.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may further limit the scope of processing to certain
              processing activities or request a correction of your data.
            </li>
            <li>
              You have the right to be informed about where, for which purpose
              and for how long which data is collected by Opspad. You may at all
              times request to receive such information in a structured,
              commonly-used and machine-readable format to transfer your data to
              another data controller.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the unlikely case that Opspad may, in your reasonable
              discretion, not comply with the applicable data protection law,
              you have the right to file a complaint directed at the competent
              regulatory authority.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Opspad may ask you to provide a proper identification of yourself
            before performing any Personal Data-related action to avoid misuse.
          </p>
          <h4>Is my data shared with third parties?</h4>
          <p>
            In order for Opspad to execute its business processes in a
            convenient and optimal manner, it may be necessary for certain data
            to be processed by trusted 3rdparties and reliable partners.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>These 3rd parties may</p>
          <ul  className='list'>
            <li>process payments</li>
            <li>fulfill orders</li>
            <li>send email</li>
            <li>
              manage communication (e.g. newsletters, security notifications,
              chat)
            </li>
            <li>website hosting</li>
            <li>conduct other related activities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            on behalf of Opspad. However, Opspad only shares such information
            needed to serve the specific purpose for which the 3rdparties were
            engaged. Opspad ensures that these 3rd parties are under similar
            obligations to maintain privacy and confidentiality as Opspad’s own
            employees are and that they will handle your information in the way
            and to the extend as Opspad itself is permitted to. Opspad does not
            allow any 3rd party to use your information for any purposes for
            which the information was not collected. The Opspad Statement
            Regarding Cookies and Other Technologies
            (https://www.opspad.com/legal/) contains information about third
            parties and their technologies, used e.g. on www.opspad.com.
          </p> 
          <p>
            Opspad will only disclose your Personal Data abroad, if it is
            necessary for the intended purpose of processing. However, as a
            member of the worldwide Opspad group of companies, every local
            Opspad entity may maintain or perform data processing operations in
            countries outside the EEA or in countries without an adequate level
            of data protection, if it is required for the fulfillment of our
            obligations or the underlying agreement with you. Furthermore,
            subcontractors of Opspad which Opspad engages to act on its behalf
            in respect to the processing of your Personal Data may be domiciled
            in such areas.
          </p> 
          <p>
            In order to secure such transfer and processing in accordance to
            chapter 5 of the GDPR, Opspad has implemented and requests the
            required technical and organizational measures as well as has
            entered into the appropriate contractual frameworks with group
            companies and subcontractors which make sure that the recipient of
            data has implemented an adequate level of data privacy in its
            organization as required by the GDPR. This includes signature of
            Data Processing Agreements as well as EU standard contractual
            clauses issued by the EU commission. These precautions are
            appropriate safeguards as requested by Article 46 GDPR and local
            data protection laws in effect, which make sure that your
            information will be treated securely, confidentially and in
            accordance to the applicable data protection laws.
          </p>
          <h4>Does Opspad sell my information ?</h4>
          <p>
            No – Opspad does not sell your information to third parties for any
            commercial or non-commercial interest (a traditional “sale”).
            However, the term “sale” may in some jurisdictions also comprise
            providing data to third parties to process payment for services,
            and, if chosen by you, the provision of your personal information to
            entities, whose products Opspad resells. If you opt out of the sale
            of your information by contacting privacy@opspad.com or clicking the
            link on the corresponding Opspad website, Opspad may be unable to
            provide services to you if your request not to sell information
            includes a prohibition on processing payments for the products you
            purchase in your jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <h4>How long will my data be stored?</h4>
          <p>
            Opspad only maintains your Personal Data for as long as it is
            required for the intended and approved purpose. Data which is
            collected on basis of your explicit consent will be retained until
            such consent will be withdrawn or expires. Some data (e.g. billing
            related data) may be subject to statutory data retention
            obligations, which Opspad adheres to. Product trial licenses are
            tied to email addresses. For fraud protection purposes, such
            addresses are subject to an extended retention term of up to 12
            months after license expiration. As soon as your Personal Data is no
            longer needed to serve the purpose of its collection and no other
            retention policies apply, Opspad has implemented revolving routines
            to delete your data. Opspad employs data destruction techniques
            designed to completely destroy data and prevent any future recovery
            in all such routines.
